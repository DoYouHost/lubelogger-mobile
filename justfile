# Recipe naming: a bare verb is earned by the ones typed weekly and safe to run
# twice (test, run, build, ship); a variant appends only what differs from the
# silent defaults — APK, stable channel (build-aab, ship-dev). Machines and
# objects read <subject>-<verb> (emu-boot, release-publish). Anything
# irreversible on GitHub is purge-<deepest thing lost>, so `just purge<TAB>`

# The listed description is the [doc] attribute, not the comment above it: just
# shows only the LAST comment line. Attributes must touch the recipe line — a
# comment between them is `error: extraneous attribute`, and it breaks the whole
# file, not one recipe. Group names are numbered because bare `just` (via
# --unsorted) reads in source order while `just --list` re-sorts alphabetically;
# the digits are what keep the two agreeing.

# wipes build/app) so a later rebuild doesn't take them out from under
