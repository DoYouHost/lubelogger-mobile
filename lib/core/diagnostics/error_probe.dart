/// Records what nobody caught: exceptions from the framework (build, layout,
/// gestures) and asynchronous errors that escaped their future.
///
/// Without this a crash is the one thing a report cannot describe. The user sees
/// a blank screen, the log shows the tap that led to it and then nothing — the
/// exception went to the console, which is exactly where a user cannot look.
///
/// ## Repeats
///
/// A widget that throws in `build` throws again on **every frame**. Sixty
/// identical records a second would empty the buffer in a minute, taking with
/// them everything that happened before the failure — the only part that
/// explains it. So the first occurrence is recorded in full and the rest are
/// counted:
///
/// ```json
/// {"evt":"uncaught","type":"RangeError","msg":"…","stack":"…"}
/// {"evt":"repeated","type":"RangeError","n":312}
/// ```
///
/// The count is written out when the storm ends (a different error arrives, or
/// the recording stops) and every [_burstWindow] while it lasts, so a burst
/// still shows up on the timeline where it happened instead of collapsing into
/// one number at the end.
///
/// ## Why no `runZonedGuarded`
///
/// Uncaught errors from the root zone already reach [PlatformDispatcher.onError],
/// so a guarded zone would add only errors thrown before a recording exists —
/// unloggable by definition.
