/// **There is deliberately no "copy to clipboard".** A clip travels to the

/// bytes on the way; past that `setPrimaryClip` throws
/// `TransactionTooLargeException`. The buffer is the lesser problem: every
/// clipboard listener on the phone — the keyboard's clip history first among
/// them — reads what was copied, so a log of a few hundred kilobytes janks the
/// device long before that ceiling, and then lives on in another app's history.
///
/// Someone who only wants a fragment can still select it in the raw log on the
/// review screen. That hands the system a paragraph instead of the session.
